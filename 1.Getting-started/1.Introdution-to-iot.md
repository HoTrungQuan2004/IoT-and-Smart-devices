### Exercide:
There are many large and small scale IoT projects being rolled out globally, from smart farms to smart cities, in healthcare monitoring, transport, and for the use of public spaces.

Search the web for details of a project that interests you, ideally one close to where you live. Explain the upsides and the downsides of the project, such as what benefit comes from it, any problems it causes and how privacy is taken into consideration.

--------------------------------------------------------------

- Project name: IoT Virtual Doctor Robot
  - Upsides:
    + Remote diagnostics:
      + Instead of needing to visit the hospital, patients can receive health examinations and medical advice at home, at work, or at school.
      + Beneficial for patients with restricted mobility or those living in remote areas.

    + High applicability:
      + Can be integrated into smart devices such as smartwatches to monitor users' health status.

	  + Quick response in emergency situations:
      + Quickly notify the nearest hospital immediately when detecting unusual signs (eg stroke...).

  -	Downsides:
    + high implementation cost:
      + Investments are needed in many areas to make this happen (e.g. big data storage, information security, sensor systems, etc.).
      + Difficult to access for people with financial problems.

	  + Depends on wifi, 5g:
      + Information cannot be transmitted to the hospital without an internet connection.

	  + The Trust Issue in AI:
      + Many people doubt that AI can make mistakes and lead to bad consequences.
