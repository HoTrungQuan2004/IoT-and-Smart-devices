### Exercise: 
This lesson covered microcontrollers and single-board computers. Create a table comparing and contrasting them, and note at least 2 reasons why you would use a microcontroller over a single-board computer, and at least 2 reasons why you would use a single-board computer over a microcontroller.

----------------------------------

|        | Microcontrollers | Single-board computers |
|--------|------------------|------------------------|
| Single-board computers | Low power, optimized for real-time processing | High power, can running full operation systems |
|Operating system|Does not run an OS|Runs all OSs|
|Cost|Low|High|
|Programming language|Uses low-level programming language (C++, C, Assembly,…)|Uses high-level programming language (python, java,…)|
|Power consumption|Low|High|
|Memory & Storage|Depend on flash memory, has no storage|Can be expand by using external storages|
|Wireless|No|Wifi, Bluetooth|

- Why you would use a microcontrollers:
  + Can be use in tasks that require real-time processing (license plate checking, fingerprint/faceid time attendance machine,…)
  +	less demanding in terms of power and battery

- Why you would use a single-board computers:
  + Can be connected by many ways from wired (HDMI, USB, …) to wireless connection (Wifi, Bluetooth,…)
  +	Suitable for handling tasks that require multitasking or using operating systems or for programs running in high-level languages
