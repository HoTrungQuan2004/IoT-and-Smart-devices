### Exercise:
This lesson covered sensors and actuators. Research and describe one sensor and one actuator that can be used with an IoT dev kit, including:

* What it does
* The electronics/hardware used inside
* Is it analog or digital
* What the units and range of inputs or measurements is

-----------------------

Sensor: Camera module (Esp32-cam)
-	What it does: It capture images and videos, allowing IoT devices can recognize human faces to unlock doors or safes
- The electronics/hardware used inside:
  + Image sensor
  + Flash
  + Wi-fi module
- Is it analog or digital: Digital
- What the units and range of inputs or measurements is: 
  + Voltage: 3.3V – 5V
  + Connectivity: Wi-fi, micro usb, …
  + Frame rate: ~ 15-60 FPS 
  + Resolution: 1600x1200 pixels 

Acuator: Electric piston
- What it does: converts electrical energy into linear motion and can be used as a lock for doors or safe.
- The electronics/hardware used inside:
  + DC motor
  + Controller
  + Lead screw mechanism
  + Limit switches
- Is it analof or digital: both (depending on what kind of controller)
- What the units and range of inputs or measurements is:
  + Voltage: 12V / 24V / 36V DC
  + Control signal: PWM or H-Bridge
  + Force: 10N - 1000N 
  + Speed: 5mm/s – 10mm/s
  + Stroke length: 10mm – 1000mm
