### Exercise:
This lesson covered MQTT as a communication protocols. There are others, including AMQP and HTTP/HTTPS.

Research these both and compare/contract them with MQTT. Think about power usage, security, and message persistence if connections are lost.

-----------------------------

|	    |MQTT|AMQP|HTTP/HTTPS|
|-----|----|----|----------|
|Power usage|Low (Optimized for low-power IoT devices) Use minimal bandwidth|The highest of the three. Need more processing power and bandwidth|High. Need constant connection|
|Security|Use basic security, simple to authenticate|Strong security with TLS, authentication, and role-based access|HTTP is secured using HTTPS Strong encryption but susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks if not configured properly|
|Message persistence if connections are lost|Real-time messaging, IoT,…|Business applications, finacial systems,…|Web application,…|
