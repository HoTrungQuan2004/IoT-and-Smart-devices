This project visualizes GPS data on a map using Leaflet.js and OpenStreetMap, hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Instructions
- The web app is built with HTML and JavaScript.
- GPS data is stored in GeoJSON format within `index.html`.
- Deployed using GitHub Pages at [link](https://github.com/HoTrungQuan2004/IoT-and-Smart-devices/edit/main/3.transport/3.%20Visualize%20location%20data/).

## Setup
